# Content Management System Course Assignment

## Goal

Create a separate website that uses an API call to your Wordpress API on your web host to populate a products page for Flower Power.

## Brief

Using the WordPress REST API, create a separate website (not build as a page on WordPress) that lists the products you created with WooCommerce on your WordPress site in Module Assignment 1. Because you're using the API, each time an administrator creates or updates a product, the change will pull through to your product list page.

Your products page should be a standalone site (written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and include a list of all the: product names, images and prices. Each product should have a call-to-action button to 'View More'.

## Level 1 Process

1. Sketch the products page you would like to make. The layout of the page is up to you, but you should use the colours and fonts from the Module Assignment 1.
2. Create the page by fetching data from the WordPress REST API on your web host (not localhost), and displaying it on the page.
3. Create a new product on your WordPress admin page, and make sure it's pulling through to your products page.
4. Upload the site to your web host.
4. Deliver a link to the products page.

## Level 2 Process (reminder: level 2 is optional)
1. Add a 'sort by' option for users to sort the products by name (A-Z) or by price (low to high).
2. Create a product specific page which shows the product details for whichever product the user clicks on from the products list page. This page should show the name, image, price, stock availability, and a description.

## Delivery

A link to the products page.

> Note: You must make a call to the API on your web host, not your localhost. Only you have access to the localhost.
