# Content Management System Course Assignment

## Goal

To create a products page using data from the WordPress REST API.

## Brief

Using the WordPress REST API, create a list of products created with WooCommerce on your WordPress site. Because you're using the API, each time an administrator creates or updates a product, the change will pull through to your product list page.

Your products page should include a list of all the: product names, images and prices. Each product should have a call-to-action button to 'View More'.

## Level 1 Process

1. Sketch the products page you would like to make. The layout of the page is up to you, but you should use the colours and fonts from the Module Assignment 1.
2. Create the page by fetching data from the WordPress REST API, and displaying it on the page.
3. Create a new product on your WordPress admin page, and make sure it's pulling through to your products page.
4. Deliver a link to the products page.

## Level 2 Process (reminder: level 2 is optional)
1. Add a 'sort by' option for users to sort the products by name (A-Z) or by price (low to high).
2. Create a product specific page which shows the product details for whichever product the user clicks on from the products list page. This page should show the name, image, price, stock availability, and a description.

## Delivery

A link to the products page.
