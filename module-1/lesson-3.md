# Lesson 3 - Site Administration

To get to the administration page for your website, you can add ‘wp-admin’ to the end of the URL. If you aren’t logged in, you will be asked to do so.

All content creation and management happens from the admin panel. It is worth remembering that a CMS divides the content and the way the content is displayed. We will get onto styling the content, but for now, let’s take a look at creating content and the various types of content on WordPress.

## Content Types

### Posts

When WordPress was developed, it was a blogging platform and ‘posts’ were the primary piece of content that was being created.

Posts are generally editorial - like a blog - and are assigned authors, dates and any tags the author wants to add. This makes it easy for users to search through posts to find topics and any posts from a specific author.

### Pages

Pages are typically what you’d expect from a website. Things like home page, about page etc. They are static and aren’t connected to authors and dates because they generally don’t change and it doesn’t matter who wrote them.

You can have child-parent relationships for pages where a page might be a sub-page of another. An example might be an FAQ page that you can click through to from the Contact page.

As a general rule, a page is something that you’d find in a menu and doesn’t get regularly updated.

### Media

Media items like images can be uploaded and are stored on the web host, while data about the media item is stored on the database. The data which is stored are things like titles and alt text. Media items can be used on different pages and posts across the site.

## Block Editor

From v5.0 and later, WordPress have rolled out an editor called Gutenberg with a unique way of creating blocks of content for the page. Using their block editor you can add individual blocks of content like Paragraph, Image, Gallery, Quote, List etc. into the page or post and edit it.

The WordPress admin panel is pretty intuitive, but if you want more information about how to set up the admin panel and use all the elements correctly, you can take a look at this video on WordPress 5 Essential Training https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-5-essential-training/wordpress-an-introduction?u=43268076

## Plugins

If you are looking for additional functionality for your site beyond the standard WordPress installation, a good place to look is for a plugin.

A plugin is a piece of software written in PHP which you can download and install to your WordPress site. Using plugins can speed up development of a project and mean you can get quite a lot of functionality without having to know how it was created.

Most plugins are offered free with limited functionality, and then you pay extra for additional functionality.
