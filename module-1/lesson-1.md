# Lesson 1 - What are CMSes and Why Use Them

## Introduction

Content Management Systems make it easy to create, update and organise content on a website. For people with minimal development knowledge this can be a great way to take control of their own website in maintainable ways.

It is likely that when working with freelance clients they will want a Content Management System like WordPress in order to control their own website rather than having to keep coming to you in order to update pages.

Throughout the Content Management course we’ll be working on one website called ‘Flower Power’, an e-commerce business that sells bouquets through their website.

## Database

One major difference between CMSes and normal static websites is their use of databases to show content to users. When content is added to a website using a CMS, the content and other meta-data gets stored in this database.

When a client visits a URL on the website, the application calls the data from the database and displays it on the page for the user according to the styles set in a theme. These pages aren’t hardcoded, but are built dynamically.

This separation of content and how the content is displayed is what makes CMSes so easy for most people to use. The building of the actual pages is handled by the application and all the user is really doing is creating new entries in a database.

## CMS Options

There are a number of different CMSes to choose from. They all have advantages and disadvantages. There are a mix of paid and open source CMS options. Below we go over three of the most popular open-source options.

### WordPress

WordPress is by far the most popular, with about 60% of the share of CMS websites. There is a very large developer community and an extensive codex helping you to make the most of the CMS.

WordPress works on PHP with a SQL database to store data.

### Joomla!

Joomla! has the second largest share in the CMS market. It offers a bit more out of the box than WordPress, but this added functionality also comes at the cost of more complexity.

### Drupal

Drupal is popular with larger websites and enterprises. It is less bloated than the other two CMS options, but that comes at the expense of requiring more technical knowledge.
