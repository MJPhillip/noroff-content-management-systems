# Module Assignment 1

## Goal

To create an e-commerce site for a company called Flower Power using WordPress. Please note that this project will continue into your Course Assignment.

## Brief

Flower Power is a company selling bouquets online. They want a website built on WordPress where they can update content and add products as they want.

The website should have the following pages:

**Home**

*	Heading saying ‘Welcome to Flower Power’ (note the home page should still be called ‘Home’ in the menu)
*	A featured image (see assets)
*	Intro paragraph (see assets)
*	“View our bouquets” call-to-action button
*	List of best selling products
*	A quote from a past customer (see assets)
*	A section called Weddings with a gallery of images

**About**

*	Text about the company (see assets)
*	An image (see assets)

**Contact**

*	A contact form


## Level 1 Process

1.	Create a local installation of WordPress.
2.	Add the ‘Storefront’ theme and activate it.
3.	Create a Home, About and Contact pages
4.	Customize the website and add the logo, site icon, tagline, and setting colours.
5.	Add the WooCommerce plugin, go through the setup wizard skipping where appropriate and adding dummy data. WooCommerce will then create a series of pages automatically for you including ‘Shop’, ‘Checkout’ and other pages needed for the payment process.
6.	Add the products to the site (see assets)
7.	Install the Contact 7 plugin and add a contact form to the contact page using a shortcode.
8.	The main menu should just have Home, About, Shop and Contact
9.	Take your local version of the site and upload to your web host. You can use this tutorial as a guide https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-move-wordpress-from-local-server-to-live-site/ (if you don’t have PHP activated on your web host, please activate it for the CMS course and then you can switch it off afterwards).
10.	Submit a link to the website on your web host.
